# Password Length Fix - Bcrypt 72-Byte Limitation

## Issue Description

The application was failing during user registration when passwords exceeded 72 bytes, which is the maximum length supported by bcrypt. The error message was:

```
password cannot be longer than 72 bytes, truncate manually if necessary (e.g. my_password[:72])
```

This was causing HTTP 500 errors during registration and potentially affecting all password-related operations.

## Root Cause

bcrypt has a built-in limitation where it can only hash passwords up to 72 bytes in length. The original code did not handle this limitation, causing exceptions when users submitted longer passwords.

## Solution Implemented

Updated the `PasswordManager` class in `/workspace/app/security/encryption.py` with the following changes:

### 1. Enhanced Password Validation
- Added byte-length validation in `validate_password_strength()` method
- Now checks if password exceeds 72 bytes and provides clear error message
- Prevents registration attempts with overly long passwords

### 2. Safe Password Hashing
- Modified `hash_password()` method to automatically truncate passwords longer than 72 bytes
- Implements UTF-8 safe truncation to avoid breaking unicode characters
- Ensures consistent behavior across all hashing operations

### 3. Consistent Password Verification
- Updated `verify_password()` method to apply same truncation logic
- Ensures passwords are handled consistently during both hashing and verification

## Code Changes

### Password Validation Enhancement
```python
# Check bcrypt 72-byte limit
password_bytes = len(password.encode('utf-8'))
if password_bytes > 72:
    errors.append(f"Password is too long ({password_bytes} bytes). Maximum is 72 bytes due to bcrypt limitations")
```

### Safe Truncation Logic
```python
# Bcrypt has a 72-byte limit, so truncate if necessary
if len(password.encode('utf-8')) > 72:
    # Truncate to 72 bytes while preserving UTF-8 encoding
    password_bytes = password.encode('utf-8')[:72]
    # Ensure we don't break UTF-8 encoding at byte boundary
    try:
        password = password_bytes.decode('utf-8')
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        # If truncation broke UTF-8, try shorter lengths
        for i in range(71, 60, -1):
            try:
                password = password.encode('utf-8')[:i].decode('utf-8')
                break
            except UnicodeDecodeError:
                continue
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Registration Failures**: Users will now get clear validation errors instead of HTTP 500 errors
2. **Consistent Password Handling**: All password operations now handle the 72-byte limit consistently
3. **UTF-8 Safe**: Properly handles unicode characters to avoid breaking encodings
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing passwords continue to work unchanged
5. **Clear Error Messages**: Users get informative feedback about password length requirements

## Impact

This fix affects all password-related operations:
- User registration (`/v1/users/register`)
- Password changes and resets
- Admin and support staff account creation
- Any other password hashing operations

## Testing

The fix should be tested with:
- Normal length passwords (continue to work)
- Passwords exactly 72 bytes long (should work)
- Passwords longer than 72 bytes (should either be rejected with validation or truncated safely)
- Unicode passwords that exceed 72 bytes when encoded

## Next Steps

After deploying this fix, the registration endpoint should handle long passwords gracefully and provide appropriate feedback to users about password length requirements.
